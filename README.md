> Aggregated posts from University of Hull students

This is an [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) powered website that aggregates RSS/Atom posts and presents them in reverse chronological order. It's purpose is to aggregate blog posts from current and past [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk/) students.

When it's live, you will be able to visit it here: <https://hullblogs.com/>.

To add your blog to the site, please follow the instructions below in the [add your site section](#add-your-site). You must be a current or past [University of Hull](https://hull.ac.uk) student in order to get your blog added.

Note that because this uses a static site generator, the content won't update automatically. The site must be rebuilt in order for new posts to show up.


## Add your blog
To add your blog, there are 2 ways you can do this - both of which are described below.

If you don't yet have a blog, keep reading! We've got some great resources to help you get started below.


### I don't have any technical knowledge
Not a problem! Simply click this link and fill out this request form: <https://github.com/FreesideHull/hullblogs.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=blog+addition+request&template=add-my-blog.md&title=%5Bblog+request%5D+INSERT_YOURNAME_HERE>

You will need a GitHub account to do this.

### I have some technical knowledge
If you aren't confident with editing JSON files, skip this section.

If you are confident with editing JSON files to GitHub, you can update the `feeds.json` file in this repository and add a new entry like this to a random position (except the very bottom).

Here's an example new entry:

```json
{
	"author_name": "Your name here",
	"github_username": "your_github_username",
	"feed_uri": "https://example.com/feed/"
},
```

The 3 properties have the following meanings:

 - `author_name`: Your name. Shown beneath your posts.
 - `github_username`: Your GitHub username. Used for displaying your avatar.
 - `feed_uri`: The URL of your Atom or RSS feed.

Editing `feeds.json` is easy. You can even do it right in your web browser: <https://github.com/FreesideHull/hullblogs.com/edit/main/feeds.json>.

Once done, you can then [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to get your blog added.

If a post includes the magic string `__excludehullblogs__` either in it's title, description, or content (even if in a HTML comment etc), it will automatically be hidden from being displayed on hullblogs.com.

## But I don't have a blog!
Not to worry! It's easy to set one up, and a fabulous experience to have too. Not only is it useful for remembering things you've done in the past, but it's great on your CV as well. Here are some places you can go to setup a free blog online with no hosting experience needed:

 - Wordpress: <https://wordpress.com/create-blog/>
 - Blogger: <https://www.blogger.com/about/>
 - Squarespace: <https://www.squarespace.com/websites/create-a-blog> (unclear as to whether it's free or not)
 - GitHub Pages: <https://pages.github.com/>
 - Netlify: <https://www.netlify.com/pricing/> (starter is free)
 	- [Templates](https://templates.netlify.com/)

If you're looking for something to host yourself, these are great places to look:

 - Wordpress: <https://wordpress.org/>
 - TODO add more here


## Run your own instance
For development (and production, if you're in charge of the hullblogs.com website) purposes, it's sometimes useful to run your own instance of this website. These instructions will have you up and running in no time!

## System (and user) Requirements
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 - A text editor (for editing `feeds.json`)
 - A web browser (we recommend [Firefox](https://firefox.com/))
 - Basic knowledge of the Linux Terminal (or Windows Command Line)

## Getting Started
First, clone this repository and `cd` into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FreesideHull/hullblogs.com.git
cd hullblogs.com
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now, you can build and serve the site locally:

```bash
npm start
```

If you just want to build it and not start the development server (e.g. if you're running a production instance), you can build it like so:

```bash
npm run build
```

It will take a moment to build, but then you'll get a message like this that shows the URL you can visit your local instance of the size:

If you're debugging the feed compatibility code, then setting the `DEBUG_FEEDITEMS` environment variable to a value will cause processed to be logged to the console.

If you're working on the CSS, note that Eleventy will *not* auto-rebuild & reload the browser. For that, you need to re-save a file it *does* watch, such as `index.html`, `.eleventy.js`, etc (even if you haven't made any changes).

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables can be used to influence the behaviour of the aggregator.

Environment Variable	| Purpose
------------------------|------------------------------
`FILTER_FEED`			| Set to any value to enable the filtering of posts based on whether they contain any bad words. Uses [futility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/futility), but with a custom algorithm on top to avoid the "[Scunthorpe Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem)".

Example of setting an environment variable when running a build:

```bash
FILTER_FEED=true npm run build
```

### Automatically rebuilding
To automatically rebuild the site every day, add this to your root crontab (`sudo EDITOR=nano crontab -e`):

```cron
sudo -u www-data bash -c 'cd /srv/hullblogs.com && npm run build >last-build.log 2>&1'
```

....replacing `/srv/hullblogs.com` with the path to the root of the git repository that you cloned.


### Design Decisions
A number of decisions were made in the design process of this website. These are documented with the reasoning behind them here.

 - **Using a static site generator:** This greatly simplifies the website and the maintenance thereof.
 - **Not using a CSS framework (e.g. bootstrap):** CSS Grid and CSS flexbox are powerful enough such that a framework such as bootstrap is not needed. In addition, the HTML structure and overall project architecture is greatly simplified by avoiding such frameworks. The aim is ensure it is as simple as possible to understand and maintain.
